General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has\njust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs\nfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,\naccording to an A and P executive.\n    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at\nthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does\nHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and\nfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.\n    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of\nGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market\ntakes off.\n    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help\npush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in\nthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a\n1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show\nno signs of picking up.\n    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee\nquality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.\n    \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name\nof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this\nwas quality coffee,\" Gallant said.\n    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the\nbrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn\naround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a\nCoke',\" he said.\n    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have\nconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are\naiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd\n-- the yuppie composite.\n    \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\n\"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are\nno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is\ngourmet,\" he said.\n    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet\nline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular\nground roast coffees produce.\n    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of\ngreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of\nroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting\noften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell\ncoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product\ndesigned to draw shoppers into the store.\n    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing\nstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade\ndiscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a\nspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.\n    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green\nbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet\ncoffee are now almost three times the price of green.\n    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.\nGeneral Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market\nsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.\n    And product manager Brown points to the success of more\nexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in\nrestricted high income areas and are now available in almost\nevery supermarket in the country.\n    A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we'll do\nextremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said.\n    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private\nCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers\nits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock\nRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,\nNew York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.\n Reuter\n"}, 41.92511691284599], "812": [{"id": 812, "title": "COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL", "body": "The failure of the International Coffee\nOrganization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas\ncould trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at\nleast 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.\n    Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80\ncents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.\n    A special meeting between importing and exporting countries\nended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks\nover how to set the quotas.

London failed to break a deadlock over\nre-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986,\nand no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.\n    Arango said that government measures adopted here last\nweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated a\nmajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.\n    \"This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world\nmarket conditions are also new,\" he said.\n    The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said\nthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed\nmore often in order to closely reflect market trends.\n    Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was\nthe decision on Friday to open export registrations for an\nunlimited amount.\n    But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy\nselling of coffee.\n    \"Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but\nconsistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react\nto market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of\ngiving its coffee away.\"\n    Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming\nexports, he said.\n    \"We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but\nneither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full\nwell what Colombia's export potential is,\" he said.\n    Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,\nexported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year\nwhich ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.\n    Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions\nbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not\nexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the\nNational Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, a figure he said was \"ridiculous.\"\n    He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the\nnumber one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was\nlikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and\noscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.\n    On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said\nColombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed\nto force a compromise.\n    Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head\nof his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the\nintransigence of some big countries, without naming them.\n    However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar\nGaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States\nwould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming\nweeks to revise its policy.\n    \"Washington will have to take into account that for many\ncountries, and some of its allies for instance in Central\nAmerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have\nfar-reaching political and economic consequences.\"\n    Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export\nquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which\ncould emerge from continuous contacts.\n Reuter\n"}, 19.96434138706952],

bottleneck in export shipments and\nadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.\n    The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the\nequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and\nprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present export\nrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.\n    The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the\neconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of\nUganda's total exports.\n    The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January\nfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments of\ncoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.\n    These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in\nUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan\nwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and\nTanzanian railway systems, the sources said\n    Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly\nacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to\nlocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for\nmoving exports.\n    Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze\nwould be resolved in two weeks.\n    However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between\nthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out\nof action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh\ndelays in cargo movements.\n    Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption\nof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned\ntheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.\n    Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB\nwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.\n    These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's\nexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)\ncrop, the sources said.\n    According to the sources, the board's financial problems\nhave been aggravated by long delays in processing export\nreceipts.\n    The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle\nexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereas\nexport bills handled by local banks took half that time to\nprocess, they said.\n    The sources said the CMB's price structure had been\novertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially\nestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further\ndisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.\n    \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months\nbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the\nsooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the\nbetter for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" one\nof the sources said.\n    The government is currently negotiating a package of\neconomic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary\nFund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to\nhelp Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now.

Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n"}, 17.967907248362568]}, "corrections": {}, "topics": {"coffee": [11609, 812, 11563, 17910, 1460, 2793, 9718, 17255, 213, 14197, 5023, 7509, 11331, 19031, 1213], "ship": [7509]}, "expansion": {"coffee": ["beverage", "drink", "drinkable", "potable", "tree", "seed", "brown", "brownness"]}, "vsm_score": {"coffe": 1}}
